# etch-a-sketch
This is my implementation of the Javascript Etch-a-sketch challenge on [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).

## Deviations from the given task
The given task asks that a "hover" effect be applied to the grid. This generally means having hover listeners over each cell. I decided to use a different approach; using only a mousemove and touchmove listener on the entire grid.

This solution also has very basic mobile compatibility. Knock yourselves out!
